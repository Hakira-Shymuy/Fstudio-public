## What is FStudio

FStudio is my own web company and this elements are used by my self and by my clients in Breakdance Page Builder ( I have my own private version )

### Where can i reach you?

I will later on provide bugs and support on Github, when i set up the things later on

You can contact me or find me at

#### What is diferent from your elements vs breakdance elements

First of all, i do not want to provide anything that breakdance already provides ( besides ) the way that things work
They are adapted for my own usability, the way that i think that makes more sense, IF that does not match how you think or, if it does not make sense, then do not install the plugin

Container is the main element here, is nothing more than a Div with all the Breakdance Div capabilities, but the controls have a diferent layout
Also, it have grid controls ( created native with breakdance elements studio )

#### Do i need to wait for Breakdance Grid or will this be better?

I do not know and i do not want to replace Breakdance Grid in the future
I want features that i need ( Right now ) and on ( My way )
