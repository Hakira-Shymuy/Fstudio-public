# FStudio-public

Public Version of FStudio elements for Breakdance

## What is FStudio?

FStudio is my own agency company, and this plugin is a public version of my own private plugin used by myself and my clients with Breakdance.

### What it does?

[Video here](https://sendspark.com/share/6gois2xjh7msh21v)

### Why did I build it?

I built it because I prefer the way I have things in my elements.

### Can you use it?

Yes, you can download this version (FStudio Public) and use it on your own or clients' websites. However, I will not be responsible for any problems, damages, incompatibilities, or any other situations caused by my plugin/elements.

## USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

### Do I provide support?

I do not provide any official support, but I can try to help.

### Where can you reach me?

You can find me on Breakdance community Discord server:
[Unofficial Breakdance Builder Community](https://discord.gg/TYXpjzvShs)

### What is different from my elements vs Breakdance elements?

First of all, I do not want to provide anything that Breakdance already provides, except on the way they work. My elements are adapted for my own usability, the way that I think makes more sense. If it does not match how you think or if it does not make sense to you, then do not install the plugin.

The container is the main element here, which is nothing more than a div with all the capabilities of a Breakdance div, but with different control layouts. It also has grid controls created natively with Breakdance elements studio.

### Do I need to wait for Breakdance Grid or will this be better?

I do not know, and I do not want to replace Breakdance Grid in the future. I want features that I need right now and in my own way.
